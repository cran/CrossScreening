Description: Cross-screening is a new method that uses both random halves of the sample to screen and test many hypotheses. It generally improves statistical power in observational studies when many hypotheses are tested simultaneously. References: 1. Qingyuan Zhao, Dylan S Small, and Paul R Rosenbaum.
